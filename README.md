# Diabetes Prediction

This project aims to predict diabetes in patients using machine learning models. It involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and making predictions based on the best performing model.
It utilizes the Pima Indians Diabetes Database to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on various medical attributes.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict diabetes in patients based on medical data. The dataset includes features such as blood pressure, BMI, age, and others.

## Description

The notebook trains several machine learning models to predict diabetes using a dataset containing various health parameters. The models evaluated include:

Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Random Forest
Naive Bayes

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing is preprocessed and scaled to improve the accuracy of the models.The dataset consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable (Outcome).

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

You can install these dependencies using pip: pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn notebook

## Results

The project demonstrates the following:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
- Data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values and scaling features.
- Training multiple machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.).
- Evaluating the performance of these models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.
